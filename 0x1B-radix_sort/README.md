# 0x1B. Radix Sort

## Interview preparation - algorithms 


Prototype: ``` void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size); ```
The LSD radix sort algorithm is implemented
It is assumed that array will contain only numbers >= 0
malloc and free are used for this task
print the array each time significant digit increases
